## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned creating react js websites and deploying them in github.
I learnt importing of images from source folder.
Creating seperate components.
Though this project did not require javascript i used it to create components.
I am proud of this component.
